# TOSCA

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

TOSCA is a packege for inferring the timing in real time of clonal and subclonal somatic copy numbers (SCNA) of type 2:0, 2:1 and 2:2. 

The package uses a Bayesian model explained in [reference] and implemented in STAN.

The input data is the result of the clonal and signature deconvolution analyses performed on WGS longitudinal data. In particular the tool needs:

1. Mutations:
- The number of private, clock-like mutations in the clonal (or subclonal) cluster of the last sample
- The number of private, therapy-related mutations in the clonal (or subclonal) cluster in the last sample
- The number of private clonal (or subclonal) mutations in double and sigle copy in the locus of the CNA of interest

2. Parameters:
- The length of the diploid genome
- The length of the CNA
- The clock-like mutation rate 

3. Time references 
- Sample collection time of each sample
- Time references for therapies of interest (exposure start and end)

The model infers:

1. Times:
- Time of origin of the Early Common Ancestor of the samples (t_ECA)
- The time of origin of the SCNA (t_CN)
- The time of origin of the Most Recent Common Ancestor (t_MRCA)
- Start and end of possible quiescence periods

2. Dynamics parameters:
- Tumour’s growth rate
- Mutation rate under therapy 

Model’s assumptions:
- Constance of clock-like mutation rate and growth rate between the first and last sample

## Installation

You can install the development version of TOSCA like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(TOSCA)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
